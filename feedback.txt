gamble allows other inputs than those that should be expected.  This results in an instant loss.
Gamble does also not specific what the cards are and what the range is.  Don't assume people know what to do in your games.
The game is rather short and should be fleshed out a bit more (remember adding more enemies can be done using polymorphism to make it easy)
Javadocs can be more fleshed out.  Some of these need more specifics to them for the coder who wants to use them.
Well done but Final projects should be longer than this in game play, especially when so much of it is reusable.
